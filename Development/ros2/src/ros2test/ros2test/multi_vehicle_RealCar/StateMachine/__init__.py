"""
Simplified State Machine Package for Vehicle Control System

This package contains a simplified state machine with only the essential states:
- INITIALIZING: System initialization and setup
- WAITING_FOR_START: Ready to begin operation
- FOLLOWING_PATH: Autonomous path following
- FOLLOWING_LEADER: Following another vehicle (platoon mode)
- STOPPED: Vehicle stopped (manual stop or safety)

Each state handles its own transition logic internally.
