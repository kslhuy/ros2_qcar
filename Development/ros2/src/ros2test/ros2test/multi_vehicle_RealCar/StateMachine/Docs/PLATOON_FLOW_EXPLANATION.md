# Platoon Command Flow - Current vs Proposed

## Current Flow (ISSUE ❌)

```
1. Ground Station sends command
   ↓
2. SETUP_PLATOON_FORMATION (configures who is leader/follower)
   ↓
   [state_base.py handles this - calls platoon_controller.setup_from_global_formation()]
   ↓
3. START_PLATOON (supposed to trigger state transition to FOLLOWING_LEADER)
   ↓
   [following_path_state.py or waiting_for_start_state.py checks if START_PLATOON]
   ↓
   ❌ PROBLEM: No validation if SETUP_PLATOON_FORMATION was already received!
       - You could send START_PLATOON without first sending SETUP_PLATOON_FORMATION
       - Vehicle transitions to FOLLOWING_LEADER without knowing its role/leader_id
       - Causes undefined behavior
```

## Proposed Flow (SOLUTION ✅)

```
1. Ground Station sends command
   ↓
2. SETUP_PLATOON_FORMATION (configures who is leader/follower)
   ↓
   [state_base.py handles this]
   → platoon_controller.setup_from_global_formation()
   → NEW: platoon_controller.mark_setup_complete() ← Set flag HERE
   ↓
   platoon_controller.setup_complete = True  ← NEW FLAG
   ↓
3. START_PLATOON (trigger state transition)
   ↓
   [following_path_state.py or waiting_for_start_state.py checks]
   → NEW: if not platoon_controller.setup_complete:
           log error and ignore START_PLATOON
        else:
           transition to FOLLOWING_LEADER
   ↓
✅ SAFE: Command sequence enforced!
```

## Key Points

### What we need to add to PlatoonController:

```python
class PlatoonController:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        self.enabled = False
        self.is_leader = False
        self.platoon_id = None
        self.leader_car_id = None
        
        # NEW FLAGS:
        self.setup_complete = False  # Track if SETUP_PLATOON_FORMATION was processed
        self.formation_data = {}     # Store formation for reference
        self.my_position = None      # This vehicle's position in platoon
```

### When SETUP_PLATOON_FORMATION is received (in state_base.py):
1. Call `platoon_controller.setup_from_global_formation(my_car_id, formation, leader_id)`
2. This method sets up the role (leader/follower) AND **sets `setup_complete = True`**

### When START_PLATOON is received (in following_path_state.py or waiting_for_start_state.py):
```python
if command_type == CommandType.START_PLATOON:
    # NEW: Check if setup was completed
    if not self.vehicle_logic.platoon_controller.setup_complete:
        logger.warning("Cannot start platoon - SETUP_PLATOON_FORMATION not yet received!")
        return None  # Ignore this command
    
    # OLD: Proceed with transition
    if not self.validate_event_data(data, ['leader_id']):
        return None
    ...
```

### Flow Guarantee:

| Command | Requires | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| `SETUP_PLATOON_FORMATION` | None | Sets `setup_complete = True`, configures role |
| `START_PLATOON` | `setup_complete = True` | Transition to FOLLOWING_LEADER (safe!) |
| `DISABLE_PLATOON` | None | Sets `setup_complete = False`, reverts to normal |

## Implementation Summary

✅ Add `setup_complete` flag to `PlatoonController`
✅ Set it in `setup_from_global_formation()` method
✅ Check it before allowing `START_PLATOON` transition
✅ Reset it when `disable_platoon_mode()` is called
