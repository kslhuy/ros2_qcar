"""
✅ COMPLETED: Simplified Event-Driven State Machine Architecture

This document summarizes the improvements made to create a much cleaner
event-driven system for the vehicle state machine.

🎯 KEY IMPROVEMENTS MADE:

1. ✅ Renamed StateHandler → StateBase
   - Better reflects its role as a base class for inheritance
   - All states now inherit from StateBase

2. ✅ Removed pending_transition Complexity  
   - OLD: Event handler sets flag → update() checks flag → transition later
   - NEW: Event handler returns transition directly → immediate execution
   - Much simpler and more intuitive!

3. ✅ Single handle_event() Method
   - Instead of multiple methods (handle_start_event, handle_stop_event, etc.)
   - Each state has ONE simple method that handles all events
   - Clean message-based interface

4. ✅ Direct State Transitions
   - Events trigger immediate transitions
   - No complex pending mechanisms
   - Clear and predictable behavior

5. ✅ Consistent Naming
   - current_handler → current_state
   - Removed duplicate methods
   - Clean, consistent codebase

🔄 SIMPLIFIED FLOW:

Ground Station → Command Handler → Current State → Immediate Transition

Example:
1. 📡 GS sends: {'type': 'start'}
2. 🔄 CommandHandler: Converts to message "start"  
3. 🎯 CurrentState: waiting_for_start_state.handle_event("start")
4. ⚡ Direct return: (VehicleState.FOLLOWING_PATH, StateTransitionReason.START_COMMAND)
5. 🚀 State machine: Transitions immediately

📁 FILES UPDATED:

✅ command_handler.py - Simplified command processing
✅ StateMachine/state_base.py - New base class (was state_handler.py)
✅ StateMachine/waiting_for_start_state.py - Example implementation
✅ StateMachine/following_path_state.py - Updated to StateBase
✅ StateMachine/following_leader_state.py - Updated to StateBase  
✅ StateMachine/initializing_state.py - Updated to StateBase
✅ StateMachine/stopped_state.py - Updated to StateBase
✅ StateMachine/vehicle_state_machine.py - Simplified integration

🎉 BENEFITS:

✅ Much simpler to understand and maintain
✅ Clear separation of concerns  
✅ Easy to add new events and states
✅ No complex event registration/dispatching
✅ Direct, predictable state transitions
✅ Consistent naming and structure
✅ Better error handling

💡 USAGE EXAMPLE:

# In waiting_for_start_state.py
def handle_event(self, message: str, data: Dict[str, Any] = None):
    if message == "start":
        # Direct transition - no flags needed!
        return (VehicleState.FOLLOWING_PATH, StateTransitionReason.START_COMMAND)
    
    elif message == "platoon_follower":
        # Configure but don't transition
        leader_id = data.get('leader_id') 
        self.configure_platoon(leader_id)
        return None  # Stay in current state
    
    # Base class handles common events (stop, emergency_stop)
    return super().handle_event(message, data)

🚀 The architecture is now much cleaner and easier to work with!
   Each state decides immediately how to respond to events,
   making the system more predictable and maintainable.
