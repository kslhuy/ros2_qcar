"""
Trust-Based Weight Module for Distributed Observer

Calculates adaptive consensus weights based on trust scores.
Implements trust-aware weight allocation with influence capping and temporal smoothing.

Key features:
1. Fixed weights for virtual node (local measurement) and self
2. Trust-proportional distribution among trusted neighbors
3. Influence capping to prevent single neighbor dominance
4. EMA smoothing for temporal stability
5. Virtual graph construction for enhanced connectivity
