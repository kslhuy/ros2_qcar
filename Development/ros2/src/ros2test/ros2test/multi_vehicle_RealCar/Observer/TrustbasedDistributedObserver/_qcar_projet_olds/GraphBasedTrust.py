Hybrid Graph-Based Trust Evaluation with Buffering

This file contains the buffered trust evaluation methods for fleet graph-based
trust evaluation. It implements a hybrid approach:
1. Buffer received states (local and fleet) for efficient batch processing
2. Calculate trust at fixed intervals using buffered data
3. Support immediate evaluation for critical situations
