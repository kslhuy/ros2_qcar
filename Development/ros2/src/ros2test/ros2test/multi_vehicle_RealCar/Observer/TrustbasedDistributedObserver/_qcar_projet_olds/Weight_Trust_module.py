        WEEK 2: Simplified trust-based adaptive weight calculation.
        
        Trust evaluation (Week 1) already handles quality gating and scoring.
        This method adds weight distribution based on trust scores and topology.
        
        Algorithm:
        1. Trust scores come directly from GraphBasedTrustEvaluator (0-1 range)
        2. Use fleet topology (graph adjacency) - vehicle_id encodes position
        3. Normalize with fixed virtual and self weights
        4. Apply influence capping (max 40% per neighbor)
        5. Apply EMA smoothing for temporal stability
        
        Parameters:
            vehicle_index  - Index of the vehicle (0-based)
            trust_scores   - Trust scores for all vehicles (0-1 range from Week 1)
